P Project – Advanced Programming
Description:

This project demonstrates an object-oriented system for managing memory and data storage efficiently. The system has been implemented using the four core principles of object-oriented programming:

🔐 Encapsulation

🧊 Abstraction

🧬 Inheritance

🎭 Polymorphism

The program simulates a console-based interface that allows the user to manage, store, and retrieve data objects while following memory management rules and OOP design patterns.
